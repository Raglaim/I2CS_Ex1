# Functions in Ex1 and all of their descriptions:

<span style="color:cyan">f</span> - Computes the f(x) value of the polynomial function at x.

<span style="color:cyan">add</span> - This function computes the polynomial function which is the sum of two polynomial functions (p1,p2).

<span style="color:cyan">equals</span> - Two polynomials functions are equal if and only if they have the same values f(x) for n+1 values of x, where n is the max degree (over p1, p2) - up to an epsilon (aka EPS) value.

<span style="color:cyan">mul</span> - This function computes the polynomial function which is the multiplication of two polynoms (p1,p2).
