# <span style="color:orange">I2CS_Ex1</span>
**Functions in Ex1 and all of their descriptions:**

* <span style="color:cyan">f</span> - Computes the f(x) value of the polynomial function at x.

* <span style="color:cyan">PolynomFromPoints</span> - This function computes a polynomial representation from a set of 2D points on the polynom. this function only works for a set of points containing up to 3 points, else returns null.

* <span style="color:cyan">equals</span> - Two polynomials functions are equal if and only if they have the same values f(x) for n+1 values of x, where n is the max degree (over p1, p2) - up to an epsilon (aka EPS) value.

* <span style="color:cyan">poly</span> - Computes a String representing the polynomial function.

* <span style="color:cyan">getPolynomFromString</span> - This function computes the array representation of a polynomial function from a String representation.

* <span style="color:cyan">add</span> - This function computes the polynomial function which is the sum of two polynomial functions (p1,p2).

*  <span style="color:cyan">mul</span> - This function computes the polynomial function which is the multiplication of two polynoms (p1,p2).

* <span style="color:cyan">derivative</span> - This function computes the derivative of the p0 polynomial function.

**Extra functions and their descriptions:**

* <span style="color:cyan">getcoefficient</span> - This function extracts the leading numeric coefficient from an algebraic term string.

* <span style="color:cyan">reverseArray</span> - Reverses the elements of the given array in place.
